# Introducing the latest version of Drunken Jimmy.



About:

Drunken Jimmy is a mobile 3D Endless Runner game and as the name of the game suggests, Jimmy is a drunken mouse who has the illusion that he's lost in an infinite desert and trying to run away.



Features:

• This game uses several numbers of filters such as Vignette, Chromatic Aberration, Film Grain, and so on to players feel the drunk atmosphere the way Jimmy feels.

• The game menu has four sessions that include:
1. PLAY GAME: Play the game.
2. ACHIEVEMENTS: Shows your high score.
3. ABOUT: Shows developer information and the ways you can contact the developer.
4. QUIT.

• The level design of this game is based on the procedural generation method and uses a shader graph that curves the world of the game dynamically.

• Mechanics of this game is simple as FUCK.
U can swipe your finger in four directions; Left, Right, Up, and Down.
Left and right is for going to left and right; Up and down is for jumping and falling.

• Collect coins as much as you can!
If you want more chances to continue you must collect coins as much as you can, but beware of those bastard obstacles (They love to bite your nuts!); If you hit them and do not have enough coins, The game leaves you with only two options:
RETRY or GO HOME!

At the up-left corner, you have coins and distance display and at the right side, you have the pause button feature.

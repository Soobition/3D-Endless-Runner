# Drunken Jimmy

Drunken Jimmy is a mobile 3D Endless Runner game and as the name of the game suggests, Jimmy is a drunken mouse who has the illusion that he's lost in an infinite desert and trying to run away.

## Features

- This game uses several filters, such as Vignette, Chromatic Aberration, Film Grain, and so on to help players experience the drunken atmosphere as Jimmy does.

- The level design is based on the procedural generation method and uses a shader graph that dynamically curves the game's world.

## Gameplay

- Mechanics are simple: Swipe left and right to move horizontally, and swipe up or down to jump or fall.

- Collect coins; no kidding, they are your saviors!

- Watch out for obstacles in the path; they can cause trouble, and if you donâ€™t have sufficient coins, they might even be fatal!

- The top-left corner displays the number of taken strides and collected coins, and the up-right side has a pause button.

> It took me around five months to develop this game as a solo developer. It was a journey of learning and enjoyment for me, and I hope you'll enjoy it as well.
